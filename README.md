# Warbler

Warbler is a Twitter-like application where you can implement login, logout, follow a user, and be followed by other users

### Description

Warbler is our first project at Rithm, and it has been an incredible opportunity for my partner and me to enhance our programming skills. We worked with a slightly larger codebase during its development, which was a new and valuable experience for us. Embracing this challenge has helped us expand our abilities, adapt to new situations, and develop our overall skillset.
